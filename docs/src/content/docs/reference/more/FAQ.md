# Frequently Asked Questions

1. Why create this project?
   * Every year, a new version of the macOS is released by Apple. With each new version, security professionals and administrators spend months waiting for the release of a security baseline. By creating an open source, community-based method for generating baselines to match new versions of macOS, the timeline for releasing these baselines should be reduced. 
2. Why are you using a command line based approach when a configuration profile is available?
   * Some configuration profiles are set once, and do not enforce the setting. Therefore, the only way to be able to validate and enforce a setting is through a command line based approach.
3. Is a mac management system required to implement the controls defined in the YAML?
   * No, but as the operating system matures, Apple has made it very clear that an MDM server will become required to properly secure and manage macOS.
